* bazel-workspace

An Emacs extension/mode for interacting with Bazel workspaces.

** Usage

With a Bazel managed file open, ~bazel-workspace~ gives you:

#+begin_html
<kbd>C-c C-c b</kbd> run bazel build
<br />
<kbd>C-c C-c t</kbd> run bazel test
<br />
#+end_html

~bazel-workspace~ attempts to find an appropriate target to run for the
open buffer.

** Install

This extension lives in a git repo. Download it first with

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/andyscott/emacs-bazel-workspace ~/.emacs.d/bazel-workspace
#+END_SRC

then do this if you use ~use-package~

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package bazel-workspace
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/bazel-workspace")
#+END_SRC

or this if you don't.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/bazel-workspace")
(require 'bazel-workspace)
#+END_SRC
